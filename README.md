# rgSQL

<img alt="rgSQL logo" align=right width=159 height=187 src="https://technicaldeft.com/rgsql_logo_small.png"/> rgSQL is a SQL database server that **YOU** get to build from scratch.

This project contains a test runner and 200+ test cases to guide you through creating a database server. The tests check your implementation can parse, type check and evaluate SQL statements. 

The test suite starts with simpler statements such as `SELECT 1;` and builds up to more complex queries that can evaluate expressions, join tables and run aggregate functions on grouped data.

### Using

To start, fork this repository. Then clone it and run:

```bash
./run-tests
```

Next, follow the instructions of the test runner. You can choose what programming language you want to build your implementation in.

If you want more guidance and suggestions for building your implementation, see the **[Build a Database Server](https://technicaldeft.com/build-a-database-server)** book.

### Tests cases

The `tests/` directory contains 13 files that check different parts of your implementation. Here's an example test that checks that you can insert multiple rows at once: 

```sql
--- can insert multiple rows
CREATE TABLE t1(a INTEGER, b INTEGER);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 2), (3, 4);
SELECT a, b FROM t1;
--- returns:
1, 2
3, 4
```
